 LP	NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - The stock of market technology giant Apple Inc could increase another 10 percent in six months because of growth in its service divisions and buzz around a new iPhone model, Barron's wrote in an article posted Saturday.

The business, money and investing publication cited offerings such as AppleCare, iTunes and iCloud in noting that the "company’s high-margin services revenue probably will continue to race quietly higher."

 TD	"As high-margin services grow, Apple could earn a higher valuation. And shares could hit $155 on iPhone," Barron's wrote.

The stock trades around $140 now, up more than 20 percent in 2017. (Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

   LP	Apple Inc. is expected to market Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.

The money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and granting a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. Those policies could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to dole out more money to shareholders or make splashy acquisitions.
